# Julia Chess Engine
The goal of this project is to make a chess engine using the Julia programming language.

## Why Julia?
I wanted to learn a new language, and Julia is one of the most interesting languages to come out in the last decade. Also it's fast, which is a necessity for this use case.

## Why Chess?
There are lots of interesting considerations that go into creating a chess engine, from modeling the board (bitboard, mailbox) to efficiently generating all possible moves. Chess is also a game that I am very interested in, even if I myself am not a very strong player.
